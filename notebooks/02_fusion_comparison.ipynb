Limitations\n","\n","Using Late Fusion allows us to combine already trained classifiers, as demonstrated in this notebook. Combining pretrained models without retraining the entire network is a practical advantage. While this can be beneficial, it can be challenging to merge the outputs of the classifiers because they may lack essential information about the original modalities. If the classifiers have already made predictions, it can be difficult for the fusion model to produce an accurate final output. In contrast, an intermediate fusion model can access both modalities directly and exploit cross-modal interactions for prediction.\n","\n","Because Late Fusion requires two fully trained models as well as additional linear layers for fusion, this architecture involves a large number of parameters.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e019fcbf","metadata":{"id":"e019fcbf"},"source":["# Comparison"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"442d8657","metadata":{"id":"442d8657"},"source":["Print the comparision table while keeping all intermediate architectures."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"d339a264","metadata":{"id":"d339a264","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767010647449,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Matti S.","userId":"15643583075842643253"}},"outputId":"153373b2-4460-4a17-dd3f-a79efa4d4b65"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n","| Metrics                   |   Intermediate Fusion (Concatenation) |   Intermediate Fusion (Addition) |   Intermediate Fusion (Hadamard) |   Late Fusion |\n","+===========================+=======================================+==================================+==================================+===============+\n","| F1 score                  |                            1          |                        0.903226  |                        0.833333  |      0.833333 |\n","+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n","| Validation Loss           |                            0.00171058 |                        0.030699  |                        0.0694984 |      0.070162 |\n","+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n","| Parameters (M)            |                            2.0945     |                        1.9145    |                        1.9145    |      3.0549   |\n","+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n","| Training Time / epoch (s) |                            1.27279    |                        1.19785   |                        1.20082   |      1.29306  |\n","+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n","| GPU Memory (MB)           |                            7.99365    |                       -0.0600586 |                        7.93359   |     11.6592   |\n","+---------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------+\n"]}],"source":["rows = list(zip(*table)) # transpose for tabulate\n","print(tabulate(rows[1:], headers=rows[0], tablefmt=\"grid\"))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"49144f86","metadata":{"id":"49144f86"},"source":["Include written analysis (200-400 words) addressing:\n","\n","Which architecture performed best and why\n","Trade-offs between parameter count and performance\n","Recommendations for when to use each approach\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
