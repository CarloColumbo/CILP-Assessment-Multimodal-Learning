    "Intermediate Fusion models enable the processing of multiple modalities before combining them. This allows the network to extract important features through convolutions from each modality before making the final prediction. Also, Intermediate Fusion uses shared convolution layers after combining the modality embeddings. This enables cross-modal interactions. We explored several fusion strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation increases the input size shared layers, resulting in a higher number of parameters. Consequently, the model is bigger and requires more computation and time. However, concatenation still gives the model the opportunity to ignore less relevant modalities and focus on the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition and Hadamard Product fusion combine the modalities mathematically at an earlier stage. This reduces the number of parameters since the output size after summing or multiplying remains the same. But it can obscure differences between modalities. For example, two samples with very different Lidar and RGB features could produce the same element-wise sum or product, potentially making it harder for the model to distinguish between them.\n"

    "The Intermediate Fusion with Concatenation architecture performs the best overall, achieving an F1 score of 1.0 and the lowest validation loss. This approach first embeds each modality separately and then concatenates the embeddings before feeding them into shared convolutional layers. This allows the network to preserve modality-specific structure while still enabling cross-modal interaction at a later stage. Because the shared layers learn how to optimally combine the modalities, the model avoids injecting noise through rigid element-wise addition or multiplication. This flexibility likely explains the strong performance of the Concatenation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of efficiency, the Concatenation model has slightly more parameters than the other intermediate fusion models (2.09M vs. 1.91M) and a marginally higher training time per epoch. However, it still requires fewer parameters than Late Fusion, which has over 3M parameters while performing notably worse. The Addition and Hadamard models are more parameter-efficient but show a clear drop in F1 score, particularly the Hadamard model, which performs worse despite having the same parameter count as Addition. This suggests that the performance cost of excessive parameter reduction outweighs the computational benefits in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For recommendations, the Concatenation architecture is the best default choice when maximizing predictive performance is the priority, as it offers the strongest balance of accuracy and model complexity. If runtime or resource constraints are critical, the Addition model is a reasonable alternative because it is faster and lighter while still performing well. The Hadamard model is less attractive because it offers no efficiency advantage over Addition yet performs worse. Late Fusion becomes appealing when high-quality pretrained encoders already exist and the goal is to avoid retraining shared multimodal layers; however, it comes with a higher parameter cost and weaker performance in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Concatenation-based Intermediate Fusion provides the most effective trade-off between flexibility, parameter count, and accuracy."
